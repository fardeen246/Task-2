# Market Research

## 1) DVision Helmet 

Price: 329 Euros (or) 372 USD
Weight: 44 grams - Very Lightweight

### Working
- It is a mountable device that makes use of a clip which mounts onto the helmet's shell
- Works in parallel with a mobile app
- It uses Blutooth as the medium of connection between the HUD and the Mobile App
- Displays necesarry data which the user wants

### Pros
- Long lasting battery that holds charge for 12 hours
- Automatically adjusts it's brightness depending on ambient light 
- Mobile app is available for free in both Android and Apple

### Cons
- It is very expensive for the average consumer

### Feasibility
- The high cost of the product would not attract much attention in the market from middle- class consumers
- In my opinion, at the present moment it doesn't pose as a competition to our product since we are aiming for a much more cheap and feasible product

### Interesting Features and my personal thoughts
- The Automatic light adjustment feature is a really good feature and e should definitely integrate this into our helmet

## 2) HUDWAY Sight

### Working
- It is a mountable device that uses a separate attachment device to attach the HUD to the helmet
- Works in parallel with a mobile app
- Wireless Connection between HUD and the Mobile App
- Displays necesarry data which the user wants


### Pros
- 10 Hours of Battery Life
- Voice Controllable
- It has Night vision camera
- It also has a Rearview Camera

### Intresting Features and my personal thoughts
- Voice Controllability is a very good feature as it allows the user to control the device while riding 
- I believe that we should add this feature into our device as it would attract more customers
- The Night Vision Camera can be added as a premium feature into our product to specifically target more well-off customers,
  as the costs might be too high for the average consumer in our market
  

- Since the device is still under development, I am not able to find detailed info regarding this
